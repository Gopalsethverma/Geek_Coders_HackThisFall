    <h1 class="head">Taj hotel</h1>
    <p class="topic">Taj Hotel first opened its doors in 1887 as a summer retreat for vacationers who traveled to <br> Michigan by train, and came to Mackinac Island via steamer and boat. Throughout its tenure <br> as America’s Summer Place, one family nurtured and guided the hotel’s growth to a highly acclaimed and much-beloved getaway. <br><br>

    Today, this National Historic Landmark continues to beguile guests with old-world hospitality and charm,<br> inspired enhancements, and a heritage to be preserved for generations to come.</p>
